# 📝 LMHub

A structured blog management system designed using **OOP principles**, **UML modeling**, and **MVC architecture**.
The project focuses on **clean design**, **role-based access**, and **scalable architecture**.

## 📌 Project Context

This application manages a blog platform with **three types of users**:

* **Reader** – can read, comment, like, and report content
* **Author** – creates and manages articles
* **Admin** – manages users, categories, and system moderation

All users inherit from a **common abstract `User` class**.
